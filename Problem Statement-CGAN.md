### Problem Statement: 

In many industries, handwritten forms and documents are still prevalent, especially in fields like **postal services**, **banking**, and **healthcare**. Processing handwritten digits such as zip codes, check amounts, or patient ID numbers can be tedious, error-prone, and slow. However, AI-powered systems using **machine learning** models like **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** can automate and streamline this process by accurately recognizing and extracting digits from scanned images or handwritten notes.

#### Use Cases:
- **Postal Services**: 
  - Automatically read **handwritten zip codes** from envelopes, speeding up mail sorting.
  - **Reduces human error** and improves sorting efficiency.
  
- **Banking**:
  - Recognize **handwritten check amounts** to automate the check processing.
  - **Speeds up transactions** and ensures accuracy in amounts.

- **Healthcare**:
  - Process **handwritten patient IDs** on medical forms and prescriptions.
  - **Improves data entry accuracy** and reduces manual workload.

Additionally, **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** can be used to **generate synthetic handwritten digits** for training purposes, which improves the robustness and generalization of the digit recognition models.

#### Goal:
- Deploy a **machine learning model** capable of **accurately recognizing handwritten digits**.
- **Reduce manual effort**, increase **efficiency**, and ensure **data accuracy** across multiple industries.
- **Improve productivity**, enhance customer experience, and reduce **operational costs** by automating the digit recognition process.
